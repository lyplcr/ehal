= Embedded Hardware Abstraction Layer.

- Is a portable interface definition and implementation for MCU peripherals. (think CMSIS, StellarisWare and the like.)
- It is crafted so that it will be very light on resources.
- Pay for what you use. Disable any of the peripherals provided via config files.

== For feature matrix check feature-matrix.txt

=== Suport for MCUs families:

- msp430/msp430f21x1
- avr/atmegaX8
- arm/lm4f120h5qr

=== A set of drivers using the above mentioned APIs:

==== In the plans are:

- hd44780  (based display drivers.)
- nrf24l01 (2.4GHz low power radio.)

=== Driver development Libs:

- jobs (Defer heavy jobs out of IRQs.)
- bbuf (zero copy circular buffer with non fixed element sizes.)
- cbuf (circular buffer that needs no lock for 1 producer - 1 consumer.)

== roadmap (in order)

* UART.
* SPI.
* hd44780 driver.
* nrf24l01 driver.
